"""
nlp_engine.py - NLP Module
Component 3: NLP Module

Handles:
- Intent detection using semantic/example-based matching
- Entity extraction from student messages
- Context-aware response generation
- Confidence scoring and clarification fallback
- Keyword fallback when optional ML packages are unavailable

Notes:
- This module keeps the same public class name: NLPEngine.
- It works without internet access.
- If sentence-transformers is installed, it uses real sentence embeddings.
- If not, it falls back to scikit-learn TF-IDF similarity.
